Technology
==========
This repository is for learning purposes. As a part of my learning, I implement many algorithms, typical problems and solutions. Most of them (probably all of them) are already implemented in the well known common libs.



Utilities
---------
Implementation of typical algorithms (like different sorting algorithms), which can be used az an util library in other projects.

Experiments
-----------
Tryouts, mini-applicaitons to recreate typical problems (like creating a deadlock), and typical solutions(like example codes for design patterns).
